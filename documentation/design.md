# 1. High Level Requirements

## Core Functional Requirements
- Create journal entries (single or batch)
- Overwrite existing journal entries (single or batch, same endpoint)
- Retrieve journal entries by date or date range
- Delete journal entries by date or date range

## Entry Data Model
Each journal entry contains:
- id: generated by service or database
- date: journal date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- sequence: ordering within a date
- points: numeric value
- entry: text content

## API Design
- Base path: /api/journal
- Single POST endpoint handles create and overwrite
- Batch operations are atomic (all succeed or all fail)
- GET and DELETE operations accept date or date range as input
- Entries are uniquely identified by date + sequence
